Sari:
	edited the instances creationg from XMLParser = new XMLParser("xml"); to creating a new ArgumentParser created through a static method in XMLParser
	Edited the unit tests and the main to work around the new method and made them pass.

Nikki:
	removed shorthand
	refactored argument/optional argument constructors
	added get/set methods to ArgumentParser, removed some unnecessary methods
